what is a string?
A string can be define as a sequence of a characters where it is enclosed in double quotes.

Syntax:
String name = "Java";

Imp String Features
Strings in Java are immutable. (cannot be changed once created).
Any modification creates a new obj.

String Buffer class
It use when we need modifiable (mutable) string.
It is thread-safe (sychronized).
common method are append(), insert(), delete(), reverse()

String builder 
It is quite similar to string buffer but faster, as it is used in single thread programs as it is not sychronized.

Difference between StringBuffer and StringBUilder

StringBuffer                        StringBUilder
It mutable                          it is also mutable
It is thread safe                   it is not thread safe
It is slow                          It is faster compare to StringBuffer
It is sychronized                   it is not sychronized

wrapper class?
Wrapper class can be define as a class which wrap an object or contain primitive data types and use it as an obj.

Why we need wrapper class?
As Java is an object oriented programming language, as it provide many advanced Features such as collections and generics which only works with an obj rather than data type. So to fill this gap wrapper class is essentials.
or 
In simple language, Java is an object-oriented language, and many of its advanced features, like Collections (e.g., ArrayList), and Generics, are designed to work only with objects, not primitive data types. Wrapper classes bridge this gap.

define autoboxing and unboxing
In Java, autoboxing and unboxing are the automatic conversions betn primitive data types and their wrapper classes.
